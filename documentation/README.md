# JSonny
A faster way to write JSON that is inspired by TailwindCSS syntax simplicity

## How It Works
JSonny is written solely in Dart, with complementary data.son and data.json files as input and output respectfully. This program reads the data.son file and parses the data.son syntax into the appropriate JSON syntax. The program then writes this syntax into the data.json file

## Why did I create this?
Whenever I write JSON syntax, typing all the insane amount of brackets, quotation marks, commas, indents, etc. becomes very tedious if I need to make a extensive JSON file. I thought about TailwindCSS and how it simplified CSS syntax with the tradeoff of unclean HTML syntax if the website requires hefty styling. And so I took the core syntax style of Tailwind and built a Tailwind-like syntax for JSON to simplify the process of making JSON files.
